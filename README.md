# AntiBuild Plugin v2.6


## About

**AntiBuild** is a simple, efficient, and lightweight Minecraft plugin designed to prevent interaction with blocks until the proper permission is granted. It stops all types of block interaction, including bucket use and painting interaction, and sends a customizable message to players who are denied building rights.

Before you say this already exists, take a look at how lightweight this plugin is compared to some others. This is for server owners who need a building prevention plugin that is as lightweight as possible.

## What is the Advantage of this Plugin?

As a server owner myself, I spent a long time searching for a plugin that simply stops guests from building until they are promoted. The existing options were bloated with features I didn't want or need, which led me to create AntiBuild. For comparison, the plugin I was previously using was 400 times larger in file size than AntiBuild. Sure, it did a lot more, but I didn't need any of that other stuff.

## Main Features

- Prevents breaking of blocks
- Allows players to break certain blocks without needing a blacklist
